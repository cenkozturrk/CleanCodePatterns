# Prototype Pattern

## Overview
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. Instead of creating a new instance from scratch, we clone an existing object.


## Key Features
- Efficient Object Creation – Avoids costly initialization.
- Encapsulates Cloning Logic – The object itself defines how it should be copied.
- Supports Deep and Shallow Copies – Allows flexibility depending on needs.
