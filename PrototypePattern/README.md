# Prototype Pattern

## Overview
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. Instead of creating a new instance from scratch, we clone an existing object.


## Key Features
- The program prompts them to choose a shipping method: standard, expedited, or international.
- Based on the input, the program uses the ShippingFactory to create the correct shipping method object.
- The chosen shipping method's ShipPackage method is called, and a message is displayed with the estimated delivery time.
