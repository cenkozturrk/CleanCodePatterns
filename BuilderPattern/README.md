# Builder Pattern

## Overview
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that helps construct complex objects step by step. Instead of using a large constructor with many parameters, we use a builder class that allows for more readable and flexible object creation.


## Key Features
- Complex objects are built gradually, allowing flexible configurations.
- Uses method chaining for better readability (e.g., .SetCPU().SetRAM().Build()).
- Ensures objects are properly configured before use.The object creation logic is separate from its representation.
- Easier to modify and extend without changing existing constructors. Ensures required fields are set while keeping optional ones flexible.
