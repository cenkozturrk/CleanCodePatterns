## OOP - Inheritance 


## Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of **Inheritance** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class, enabling code reuse and a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## Key Features
- A **base class** `Employee` with common properties like `Name` and `ID`.
- Two **derived classes**:
  - `Manager`: Adds a `Department` property.
  - `Developer`: Adds a `ProgrammingLanguage` property.
- Dynamic behavior through method overriding (`DisplayDetails`).
- Interactive console application for creating and displaying employee details.

## Usage
Run the program and enter details for either a `Manager` or a `Developer`. The program will dynamically create the appropriate object and display its details using inheritance principles.
