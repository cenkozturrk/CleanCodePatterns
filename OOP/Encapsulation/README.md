## OOP - Encapsulation

### Key Features:
1. Demonstrates the use of private fields and public methods to ensure controlled access to sensitive data.
2. Example: `BankAccount` class encapsulates balance management using:
   - Private fields (`balance`)
   - Public methods (`Deposit`, `Withdraw`, `GetBalance`) for secure interaction
   - Validation logic to prevent invalid operations.

### Test Demo:
A console application shows:
- Depositing money into an account.
- Withdrawing money with error handling for insufficient funds.
- Checking the balance after each operation.
