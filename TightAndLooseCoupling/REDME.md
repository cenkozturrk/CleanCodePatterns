# Loose Coupling vs. Tight Coupling

## Overview
This layer demonstrates the difference between Tight Coupling and Loose Coupling in C#. The goal is to show how loose coupling improves code maintainability, flexibility, and testability.

## Understanding Coupling

- Tight Coupling: Direct dependency between classes, making modifications difficult.
- Loose Coupling: Dependency is managed via interfaces, making the system more flexible and scalable.
